## Notes
- If Game or Game Listener is not running, all requests will result in timeout
- If Game has not desktop focus, all requests will result in timeout
- If REST server is off, Game Listener will be stopped and can not will be run again until server turn on
- Running Game Listener after clearing language file can be problematic, load game solves it
- Running state can be cancelled any time clearing or setting to false the **global variable**, default: **albionAPI_9999**
- By default files used are, [GAME_PATH]/t/9999-Lxxx.xml file and [DATA_PATH]/log9nnnn.txt range
- **api.albion** can be called directly passing needed params (not recommended)

**Environment variables**
```js
process.env.IP
process.env.PORT
process.env.TIME_OUT
process.env.TICK
process.env.GAME_PATH
process.env.DATA_PATH
process.env.LANGUAGE
